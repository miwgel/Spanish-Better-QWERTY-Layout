# Custom Spanish Keyboard Layout for Multilingual Mac Users

If you've purchased a Mac with an English keyboard layout but communicate in Spanish, you may have had to adjust the keyboard layout to match your language. This can cause confusion as the physical keys no longer match the characters they produce, especially when typing special characters like `ñ`, `á`, `é`, `í`, `ó`, `ú`, `@`, `#`, `$`, etc.

To address this issue, I've created a modified version of the English keyboard layout. This layout maintains the original English key mappings, but also allows you to type special characters using the `Option` key.

Here's how you can type these special characters:

- `á` : Press `Option` + `a`
- `é` : Press `Option` + `e`
- `í` : Press `Option` + `i`
- `ó` : Press `Option` + `o`
- `ú` : Press `Option` + `u`
- `ñ` : Press `Option` + `n`

This solution ensures that the keys on your keyboard match their output, while still allowing you to type in your language.
